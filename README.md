## Hashing to Elliptic Curves

**IETF Data Tracker**: [draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve)

**Internet-Draft**: [git repository](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve)

This document specifies a number of algorithms that may be used to encode or hash an arbitrary string to a point on an elliptic curve.

### Reference Implementation

The purpose of this implementation is for generating test vectors and enabling cross compatibility with other implementations.

This implementation is for reference only. It MUST NOT be used in production systems.

#### Other implementations
