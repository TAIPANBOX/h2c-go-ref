## Hashing to Elliptic Curves

**RFC Draft**: [draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve)

This document specifies a number of algorithms that may be used to encode or hash an arbitrary string to a point on an elliptic curve.

### Reference Implementation

The purpose of this implementation is for generating test vectors and enabling cross compatibility between other implementations.

Note that this implementation cannot be used in production systems because side-channel countermeasures are not included.

### Contact

Feel free to open a github issue for anything related to the implementation, otherwise [e-mail](draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve@ietf.org) authors of the draft.
